GLINE Documentation.


___ OVERVIEW ____

Each admin decides what users they want to allow to use their server
via I: lines.  The same applies to G: lines...they get to decide what
users they want banned, if any.  You don't have to listen to Glines if
you don't want.  Each admin sets the "lifetime" of Glines on their server.
Each admin can configure from what opers, from what servers, and for what
users they'd like or not like Glines added.  As you can see, the admin
is left fully in control of his own server.


___ GLINE.CONF ____

Hopefully, it is not too complicated.  There are 4 configuration
commands.  1 is for setting the lifetime of the Glines on your
server, and the other 3 are for rules.  You must define all
3 rules, or Glines will NOT be added to your server.  The default
for each rule is "DENY *" and if any of the 3 rules end up with 'DENY'
then the Gline is not added (which is why if any of the rules are missing,
the Gline is denied).

1) LIFETIME   - Number of seconds that Glines should live on your server.
                This is a 1 line command.  Usage:
                    LIFETIME seconds or LIFETIME=seconds
2) FROMSERVER - Rule for matching the servername the oper is on who did
                the GLINE.
3) FROMOPER   - Rule for matching the oper that did the GLINE.
4) FORUSER    - Rule for matching the mask the oper is trying to add.

Usage for all rules:
RULE
## ***NOTE*** The 1st ALLOW or DENY is the _DEFAULT_ (file is backwards)
     ALLOW blah
             EXCEPT blah
     DENY blah
END
^^^ END is required to end the rule.

Comments in gline.conf are lines that begin with #.
